"1, ★",Kaput in 5 months.,"5 months. Yes. 5 months it lasted before throwing me pop ups saying ""This drive needs to be formatted"",Nonetheless, till it's death it worked pretty well. Never had a problem with it."
"5, ★",Excellent,"I shall simply say that this item is totally worth the price tag.

"1, ★",DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. BE VERY CAREFUL IN BUYING EXTERNAL HARD DISK,I would like to bring to all the customers attention who are relying on buying external hard disk. These are highly delicate from inside and if not handled with care you will loose all your precious data. I bought this tablet just 4 months back of WD Elements of 1 TB and I am now thinking myself a stupid fool of doing this big mistake of buying this product. I had taken all my backup and was fully thinking that now my data is safe. To my horrible surriprise when today I plugged in the USB wir...
